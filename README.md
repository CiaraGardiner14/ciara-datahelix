## Background

The generation of representative test and simulation data is a challenging and time-consuming task. The DataHelix generator allows you to quickly create data, based on a JSON profile that defines fields and the relationships between them, for the purpose of testing and validation. The generator supports a number of generation modes, allowing the creation of data that both conforms to, or violates, the profile.
